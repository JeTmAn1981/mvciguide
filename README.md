I built this app as a way to learn React Native.  I ended up completing the app and publishing the Android version on the Google Play store, where it has received more than 1,000 downloads (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mvciguide&hl=en_US) and excellent reviews. 

Graphic design isn't my strong point, so it doesn't look like much but I was pleased with the content I was able to include with this app.  It's a fighting game move app, meaning it gives you a list of characters for the game and how to perform each move, but I was also able to include extra data such as frame data and character biographies, as well as automatic YouTube searches for combos and famous players of a given character, something most fighting game guides didn't do.

There's a good bit of sloppy code in here as I was working pretty quickly to get the app out in time for the game's release.  There's definitely a lot of in-line style usage that I would prefer to be done more elegantly.  But overall this was a very good learning opportunity for me and React Native.
